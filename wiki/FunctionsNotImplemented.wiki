#summary List of functions and data types which will never be implemented
#labels Phase-Implementation,Phase-Support

Some functions require some support to work.
In a real C standard library, these functions would use o/s-specific system calls. Since we are in a freestanding environnement, this is not possible.

If you want to use these functions, I recommend you implementing them and appending them to this code.
